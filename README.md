# spectrogram-ish

Using https://processing.org to visualize sound, perhaps for live performance. As sound is picked up on your computer's microphone, this sketch produces two rows of spectrogram-like marks before the slate is cleaned to start again.

# Installation

There are two folders in this project:
- `spectrogram` contains the code used to make the visualization above
- `waveform` contains a simpler version that just shows you a wavy waveform as the mic picks up sounds

1. Copy them into your processing sketches folder. On a mac, this is typically `~/Documents/Processing`.
2. Open either of these sketches in Processing.
3. Make some sounds (like talking, yelling, singing) and see things appear and change on screen.

## Thanks for your kind attention.
